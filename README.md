# Express Dev Skills

This deliverable lab focuses on creating a full-stack website with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

The site is built with the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Express
- EJS

To run the website, download the Git Repo. Once opening it up, run the commands

`npm install`

then, once that finishes, run

` npm start`

Then, on your computer, navigate to

`localhost:3000`

in your browser.

## Enjoy!
